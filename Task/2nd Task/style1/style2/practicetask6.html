            My name is………. I am thirteen and a student in class eight. I am the only son of my parents, and I belong to a large combined family. I like to spend time with my grandparents in my leisure as they tell me old and interesting stories. They inspired me to write poems and short stories. Though watching cartoon is my favorite, I enjoyed the discovery channel most on tv. My mother helps me to prepare my lesson at home. I like to work with her in the kitchen garden.
            I like to go to school every day. They not only teach us but also motivate us to do many extra-curricular activities. I use to play with my friend after school. My hobby is collecting stamps from different countries and parenting animals. I have a pet dog and a cat. I want to be a veterinary doctor in the future.
